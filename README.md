# Amaze Code Challenge

## Running this code

1. clone the repository
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start -- <number>` ex: `npm start -- 3`

Tests can be run with `npm test` and `npm run coverage`.

## What am I pleased with?

It always feels good to solve a problem and finish a solution.

I hadn't seen (or remembered seeing) the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm before. I enjoyed modifying to get the desired result. I spent a little time learning about prime numbers, trying to determine how often they occur and how to express that mathematically.

I also hadn't had a need/use for the built-in `console.table` before. It worked perfectly in this instance.

## What would you do if you had more time?

I would add in perf benchmarking for the algorithm. This way I could more objectively look at my solution and see how changes would affect the performance. I would then add implementations in different languages, doing the same, seeing which one was the most performant.
